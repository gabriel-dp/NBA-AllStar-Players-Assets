## ‚öôÔ∏è Automations

Most of the few Basketball Data APIs have some limitations that would slow down the project.

Python Web Scraping automations were used to get data from the official [NBA](https://www.nba.com/) website using [Selenium](https://github.com/baijum/selenium-python).

Another repetitive tasks were made with automations:

- POST data
- Optimize team logos in [SVGViewer](https://www.svgviewer.dev/)
- Remove white background from signatures in [IMGONLINE.TOOLS](https://imgonline.tools/remove-white-background)
- Trim images background in [Trimmy](https://trimmy.io/)

The codes are very simple and not scalable, created for temporary use only, but they helped a lot to finish this project.
